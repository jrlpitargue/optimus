# Optimus

## Usage
If `makefile` is available on your machine, simply call `make` on the root folder of the project to compile and run everything.

Alternatively, you can compile and run the source files yourself:
```bash
cd optimus
javac -d bin src/*
java -cp bin Main
```

### Usage Notes
1. The resulting iterations will be displayed on the console. This is due to the fact that this project is unfinished. An update may be rolled out in the future to amend this, but that is highly unlikely.
2. There is currently no option for minimization.
